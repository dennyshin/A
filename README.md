# A
keeping track of my unity progress


## A little about me
Most of my programming experience is with python and R for data analysis and AI. Many of my finished code have been for school projects. I have only some experience in actual implementation of ideas. So, I wanted to use unity as a fun way to practise code and make some games along the way.

There is currently an 'AngerBird' (angry birds clone) project that I have not uploaded yet, which was my actual very first project (quite some time ago).


## A
This game was for me to get used to using the unity interface and C++ syntax.  
I managed to:  
*  Get a cube moving using WASD keys
  * does NOT move in relation to the camera's POV. It instead moves relative to the world's axis (incorrect and unintended, can be fixed)
* Have control over the camera similar to a strategy game  
  * 3rd person, controlling the world from outside
  * use the arrow keys to move
  * no rotation, no zoom

A lot of things can be very much improved. Nonetheless, this project helped me get comfortable with the environment. Most of all, I wanted to move onto the next project, Maze.


## Maze
I want this project to have a bigger scope than my first. I want to learn NavMesh to allow me to move a player. I also want to add camera controls like my previous project but with zoom, rotation and mouse control. I can see myself also wanting to add fog of war and random level genertaion but let's go one step at a time.
